  <p>A beautifully OOP-focused design from my first time writing C++ as part of my Year 10 Systems Engineering elective</p>

### What might seem like a simple 3-minute program is actually a beautifully crafted small OOP program, which is the whole reason why I put this up on my GitHub.
### I encourage you to look at `/src` rather than see what this project is!

## Features
- Choose between a simple accumulative-based or a [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller) controller for following lines.
- Highly modularised components for mixing and matching as long as they share the same interface.
- Custom debug handler for logging different levels/categories: general, general w/ debug, infrared, motor.
